    <div class="card-2"><p><b>How to Play:</b> <br><br>
        Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player board game played on a 3x3 grid. <br><br>
        The objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. <br><br>
        Players take turns marking empty spaces with their respective symbols. <br><br>
        One player uses "X," and the other uses "O." <br><br>
        The game starts with the player using "X," and turns alternate. <br><br>
        Once a space is marked, it cannot be occupied by the opposing player. <br><br>
        The game ends when a player successfully aligns three of their symbols in a row. <br><br>
        If the entire grid is filled with no winner, the game is a draw. <br><br></p>
